[[unLearn|unLearn]] at its current implementation is a proposal based treasury management system. The proposal part is available, open and permissionless for everyone.
To update the state of the [[proposal_x|proposal_x]] with the results (passed or not, etc.), an NFT([[proposal_x_R|proposal_x_R]]) is minted which is sent to the address of the voting script/multisig. To update the state of the proposal with the results this NFT must be burned in the [[results update tx|results update tx]]. As a first step, I propose to have the NFT be sent to a multisig address. We can start organizing the guilds and groups around multisigs, maybe by using Summom.

Creating an [[unLearn|unLearn]] instance for each guild and start the use and testing of the proposal system with governance still in the hands of the community and the guild pioneers (ig?). By the time the validator for an updatable members list for an [[unLearn|unLearn]] instance is built, we can transition into opening up governance to everyone, with additions and removals of members happening through proposals, transitioning into an open and permissionless governing model. Members can be multisigs, like the original multisig of each guild, individuals and validator scripts(og/discoin weigthed voting, some DID system, reputation system, etc).

I have to stress again at this point that only the governance part will initially be in the "inner" community and the guild multisigs. The proposal part is open to everyone.

It consists of the [[Treasury|Treasury]] and the [[Governance Aggregator|Governance Aggregator]] validators.
